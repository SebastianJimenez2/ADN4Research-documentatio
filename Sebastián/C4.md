**Context:** System Context diagram - This diagram shows the system in context, providing an overview of the system and its environment. The system here has the highest level of abstraction, and it shows the system under consideration as a box in the center, surrounded by its users and other systems that interact with it.  
**Container:** Container diagram - This diagram shows the high-level components or services within the system and how they are connected. It shows each component as a box with its internal details abstracted away, separately deployable or executable. Containers can represent APIs, databases, file systems, etc.  
**Components:** Component diagram - This diagram shows the internal components of a container and how they interact with each other. Here, we can visualize abstractions in our codebase. For example, C # is an implementation class behind some interface.  **Code:** Code diagram - This diagram shows the detailed structure of a single component or module, including its classes and their relationships.
